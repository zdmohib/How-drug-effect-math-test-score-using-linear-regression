# How-drug-effect-math-test-score-using-linear-regression

Here I try to show with data visualisation and linear regresstion that
how drug concerntration in the tissue effect test performance

I done this project based on a research paper named "Correlation of performance test scores with “tissue concentration” of lysergic acid diethylamide in human subiects"
 research paper URL (https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpt196895635)
 
 Accordind the research they got the line equation about S = 89.7 - 9.44 CT
 and I got the line equation S = 89.1 - 9.0094 CT
